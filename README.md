# websiteinspector
Bashtool to monitor any website for HTTP-CODE, TLS-TTL and the HTTP response time. You will get an mail notification for each alarm.

This tool has been programmed to monitor all of your desired websites. The webinspector detected automatically if a website use HTTPS (443) and also checks the expire of the TLS certificate. If the website use only HTTP (80) the webinspector check the site without the TLS-TTL.

- Bash as a shell
- A working mailserver
- Tools: mailx to send mails, curl, host and openssl
- Create a cronjob
- Define the variable **MAILFROM** and **MAILTO** in websiteinspector
- Enter the desired URL in the variable **WEBSITES**. 
  - Example for the variable WEBSITES: **WEBSITES="https://github.com http://www.postfix.org"**

### Information:
- You can change in config\_websiteinspector.cnf the values for TLS-WARN, TLS-CRIT and HTTP-RESPONSE-TIME
- The websiteinspector call a website and expect the 200 HTTP-CODE. Each redirect will be followed until the HTTP-CODE 200 is reached
- If websiteinspector not found an HTTP-CODE 200, this is treated as an error
- If the TLS-TTL (SSL certificate expire date) is lower then 14 days and higher then 7 days this will be handled as **warning**
- If the TLS-TTL (SSL certificate expire date) is lower then 7 days this will be handled as **alarm**
- If the website takes longer then 3 seconds to load this will be handled as **alarm**
